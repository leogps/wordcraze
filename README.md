Word Craze is a classic timed anagram solver game. A random five lettered word is selected and its letters are jumbled and the gamer is presented to find the dictionary words from it.
            
            1. Three Lettered words: The number of three lettered words that are recognized from the word.
            
            2. Four Lettered words: The number of four lettered words that are recognized from the word.
            
            3. Five Lettered words: The number of five lettered words that are recognized from the word.
          
            The game is over if the gamer is not able to solve atleast one of the categories above (make 'em zero) before time runs out.
            
            The game transitions to the next word after the time runs out iff atleast one of the categories is fully solved or if all the categories are solved, the game transitions to the next word immediately.
